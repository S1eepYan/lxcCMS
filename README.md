With the help of this project, you can also learn how to use Nginx/Apache web server, MySQL and maybe Docker if you want.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

To run this project on your machine, you need to install nodejs7, angular cli, Tomcat8.

You also need to install MySQL(5.7+), aria2c, Nginx/Apache. Installing theme using Docker is recommended. Install Docker on your machine. If you donâ€™t know how to do it , check out **[this website]( https://www.docker.com/)**

You can replace aria2c with Transmission, checkout my [code](https://github.com/lixiaocong/transmission4j)

### Installing

Open your terminal on Linux/Mac or command window on Windows
```
docker run --name nginx -d -p <your local port>:80 -v <your local folder>:/usr/share/nginx/html nginx:stable
docker run --name aria2 -d -p 6800:6800 -v <data-path>:/home/aria2 -v <config-path>:/etc/aria2 -e TOKEN=123456 vimagick/aria2
docker run --name mysql -d -p <your local port>:3306 -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root mysql:5.7 docker run --name mysql -d -p 3306:3306 -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root mysql:5.7 --character-set-server=utf8mb4 --collation-server=utf8mb4_unicode_ci
```
The token for aria2c is **123456** and the config file can be found in current folder as **aria2.conf**

The username and password of MySQL are both **root**
Execute db.sql to init your database
